# DynamicWallpaper
A webui/sync program to change your wallpapers.

# Explanation

The server/webui part acts as the interface for any user to add/delete images.

The client/sync should be ran at intervals to keep the local images in-sync with the server, then use any wallpaper program (like feh) to put your wallpaper from the local collection.

# Why?

- Learning opportunity.
- Allows multiple computers/friends to have the same collection of wallpapers.

# Security
I am but a beginner, I cannot guarantee that there is no exploits.

# Installation

todo!()

This is one of the reason the webui is password-protected.
