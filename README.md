# DynamicWallpaper
A webui/sync program to change your wallpapers.

The server/webui part acts as the interface for any user to add/delete images.

The client/sync should be ran on at intervals to keep the local images in-sync with the server, then use any wallpaper program (like feh) to put your wallpaper from the local collection.
